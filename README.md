Using Particle mesh devices for environmental sensor streaming and Plotly/Dash for visualization



## Local Environment Setup  

  1. Install     
    - Python3+  
    - Condas
   
  2. Python libraries  
    - Using condas we should be able to install most libraries
      It is advised to install using condas first, pip at a last resort
      Create environment from the environment.yml file:
      <pre><code> conda env create -f environment.yml 
      
      </code></pre>
